As a potential employer I want to get an impression of the web developer.

The portfolio displays useful data, showcases skills and technologies of the web developer and gives a first impression.


## Technology used

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Google Fonts
* Getform.io
* ScrollMagic

**Note** In the future I'd like to exchange getform with php get method
